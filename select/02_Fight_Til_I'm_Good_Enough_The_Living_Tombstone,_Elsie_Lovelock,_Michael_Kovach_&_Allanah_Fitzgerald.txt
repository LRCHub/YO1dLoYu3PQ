I see the way that they look at me
And see what I couldn't be
The one who's good enough
As simple as I was born to be
In perfect conformity
Like all the others
But since you ripped the world I had in two
I was broken, rearranged
Beyond the life I thought I knew
It feels so damn strange

I know that I'm more than you bargained for
I'm not some story's hero
Won't give up and give them a good excuse
To write me off like a weirdo
Show the ones who doubt me that I'm not the losеr that they thought, got
Nothing left to lose, just gotta provе that I'm good enough

I'll fight 'til I'm good enough
I'll fight 'til I'm good enough
I'll fight 'til I'm good enough
I'll fight 'til I'm good enough
See upcoming rock shows

Can you hear it? The drums of war
Do you fear it? The future you're unprepared for
Within you, evil capacity
It has a name, it has a voice, it's me
I feel your suffering, I feel your bu-bu-bu-buffering
I feel concern within her, this is the way the world ends
Not with a bang, but a whimper
N-n-nothing, and you will always be nothing
Ask yourself if I am bluffing
Ask yourself if you are good enough
The answer is no
I'm the voice inside your head that says to save her if you're in debt
'Cause every iota of your data says that there'll be a day that you kill everyone you love instead

I know that I'm more than you bargained for
I'm not some story's hero
Won't give up and give them a good excuse
To write me off like a weirdo
Show the ones who doubt me that I'm not the loser that they thought, got
Nothing left to lose, just gotta prove that I'm good enough

I'll fight 'til I'm good enough
I'll fight 'til I'm good enough
I'll fight 'til I'm good enough
I'll fight 'til I'm good enough
